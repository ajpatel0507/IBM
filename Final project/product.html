          <h2>Hardware</h2>
          <p>For low cost and a quick design turnaround time, the hardware design of the IBM PC used entirely "off-the-shelf" parts from third party manufacturers, rather than unique hardware designed by IBM.</p>
          <p>The PC is housed in a wide, short steel chassis intended to support the weight of a CRT monitor. The front panel is made of plastic, with an opening where one or two disk drives can be installed. The back panel houses a power inlet and switch, a keyboard connector, and a series of tall vertical slots with blank metal panels which can be removed in order to install expansion cards.</p>

          <h2>Motherboard</h2>
          <p>The PC is built around a single large circuit board called a motherboard which carries the processor, built-in RAM, expansion slots, keyboard and cassette ports, and the various peripheral integrated circuits that connected and controlled the components of the machine.</p>
          <p>The peripheral chips included an Intel 8259 PIC, an Intel 8237 DMA controller, and an Intel 8253 PIT. The PIT provides 18.2 Hz clock "ticks" and dynamic memory refresh timing, and is used to generate the PC speaker sound output</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="third-row">
        <div>
          <h2>CPU & RAM</h2>
          <p>The CPU is an Intel 8088, a cost-reduced form of the Intel 8086 which largely retains the 8086's internal 16-bit logic, but exposes only an 8-bit bus.[52] The CPU is clocked at 4.77 MHz, which would eventually become an issue when clones and later PC models offered higher CPU speeds that broke compatibility with software developed for the original PC.[53] The single base clock frequency for the system was 14.31818 MHz, which when divided by 3, yielded the 4.77 MHz for the CPU (which was considered close enough to the then 5 MHz limit of the 8088), and when divided by 4, yielded the required 3.579545 MHz for the NTSC color carrier frequency.</p>
          <p>The PC motherboard included a second, empty socket, described by IBM simply as an "auxiliary processor socket," although the most obvious use was the addition of an Intel 8087 math coprocessor, which improved floating-point math performance.</p>
          <p>From the factory the PC was equipped with either 16 kB or 64 kB of RAM. RAM upgrades were provided both by IBM and third parties as expansion cards, and could upgrade the machine to a maximum of 256kB.</p>

          <h2>Display</h2>
          <p>While most home computers had built-in video output hardware, IBM took the unusual approach of offering two different graphics options, the MDA and CGA cards. The former provided high-resolution monochrome text, but could not display anything except text, while the latter provided medium- and low-resolution color graphics and text.</p>
          <p>The software and hardware of the PC, at release, was designed around a single 8-bit adaptation of the ASCII character set, now known as code page 437.</p>

      <section class="fifth-row">
        <div>
          <h2>Storage</h2>
          <p>The two bays in the front of the machine could be populated with one or two 5.25" floppy disk drives, storing 160kB per disk side for a total of 320kB of storage on one disk.[57] The floppy drives require a controller card inserted in an expansion slot, and connect with a single ribbon cable with two edge connectors. The IBM floppy controller card provides an external 37-pin D-sub connector for attachment of an external disk drive, although IBM did not offer one for purchase until 1986.</p>
          <p>Although official hard drive support did not exist, the third party market did provide early hard drives that connected to the floppy disk controller, but required a patched version of PC DOS to support the larger disk sizes.</p>

          <h2>Human interface</h2>
          <p>The only option for human interface provided in the base PC was the built-in keyboard port, meant to connect to the included IBM Model F keyboard. The Model F was initially developed for the IBM Datamaster, and was substantially better than the keyboards provided with virtually all home computers on the market at that time in many regards - number of keys, reliability and ergonomics. While some home computers of the time utilized chiclet keyboards or inexpensive mechanical designs, the IBM keyboard provided good ergonomics, reliable and positive tactile key mechanisms and flip-up feet to adjust its angle.</p>
          <p>Public reception of the keyboard was extremely positive, with some sources describing it as a major selling point of the PC and even as "the best keyboard available on any microcomputer."</p>

          <h2>Communications</h2>
          <p>Connectivity to other computers and peripherals was initially provided through serial and parallel ports.IBM provided a serial card based on an 8250 UART. The BIOS supports up to two serial ports.IBM provided two different options for connecting Centronics-compatible parallel printers. </p>
